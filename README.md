Creating an operating system is a complex and ambitious project that requires a solid understanding of computer science principles, programming, and system architecture. Here's a high-level overview of the steps involved:

1. Learn the Basics
Programming Languages: Master C and Assembly, as they are fundamental for OS development. C++ and Python can also be useful.
Computer Architecture: Understand how CPUs, memory, and I/O devices work.
Operating System Concepts: Study how existing operating systems (like Unix/Linux, Windows) handle processes, memory management, file systems, and device drivers.
2. Plan Your OS
Purpose and Goals: Define what you want your OS to accomplish. Is it for learning, a specific application, or to improve on existing systems?
Features: Decide on the key features such as multi-threading, multi-tasking, security, and user interface.
3. Set Up Your Development Environment
Toolchain: Install necessary tools like compilers (GCC for C/C++), assemblers (NASM), and linkers.
Version Control: Use Git or another version control system to manage your code.
Development Environment: Set up an IDE or text editor configured for OS development.
4. Start with a Bootloader
Bootloader: Write a simple bootloader that initializes the system and loads your OS kernel. This typically involves working with Assembly.
GRUB: Consider using GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) to load your kernel, as it can simplify the bootloading process.
5. Develop the Kernel
Kernel: Start with a basic kernel that can run in protected mode, handle interrupts, and perform basic I/O operations.
Memory Management: Implement basic memory management, such as setting up the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) and handling memory allocation.
Interrupts: Set up the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) and write interrupt service routines (ISRs).
Task Scheduling: Implement a simple task scheduler to manage process execution.
6. Implement Basic System Calls
System Calls: Create a mechanism for user programs to interact with the kernel. This involves defining system call interfaces and handlers.
7. Build Essential Components
File System: Develop a basic file system to handle file storage and retrieval.
Device Drivers: Write drivers for essential hardware components like the keyboard, display, and storage devices.
Process Management: Implement process creation, termination, and context switching.
8. Develop User Interface
Command Line Interface (CLI): Start with a simple CLI for user interaction.
Graphical User Interface (GUI): If you aim for a more advanced OS, consider developing a GUI later.
9. Testing and Debugging
Testing: Continuously test your OS on different hardware and virtual machines.
Debugging: Use debugging tools to identify and fix issues. QEMU and Bochs are useful for OS development debugging.
10. Documentation and Community
Documentation: Write thorough documentation for your code and design decisions.
Community: Share your project with the open-source community for feedback and contributions.
